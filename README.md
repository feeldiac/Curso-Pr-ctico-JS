# **Hypatia**

Hypatia is *a handy tool* for doing calculations in areas such as geometry📐, arithmetic, and statistics📊. We do the math, making your work faster.

## About

Hypatia is the solution from the proposed challenge in the [practical javacript course](https://platzi.com/clases/javascript-practico/ "Curso Práctico de Javascript - Platzi") from Platzi💚. Although the main porpuse was to put into practice some javascript concepts I created an interesting interface combining a simple and responsive layout and a cute color palette from [Happy Hues](https://www.happyhues.co/palettes/10)💫.

Hypatia was a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher. She is the earliest female mathematician of whose life and work reasonably detailed knowledge exists. This is a way to pay tribute to her and remember his work.
